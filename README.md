JSON-RPC Viewer is an extension to help viewing JSON-RPC requests in a more convenient way than Network tab allows.
You can view a list of requests with method name, params and result/response.
Method name filtration and JSON-RPC batch requests are not implemented yet.

Feature requests, bug reports and pull requests are welcome here: https://github.com/kityan/json-rpc-viewer.
